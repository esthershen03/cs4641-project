## Music and Mental Health
Final group project for CS 4641: Machine Learning, completed in Spring 2024.

This repository contains the following files:
- **mxmh_survey_results.csv**: dataset containing self-reported music preferences and mental health conditions from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/code/catherinerasgaitis/music-mental-health-eda/input)
- **Linear_Regression_Model.ipynb**: linear regression model for this dataset using scikit-learn's LinearRegression class, with visualizations
- **Linear_SGD_Model.ipynb**: linear stochastic gradient descent (SGD) regression model using scikit-learn's SGDRegressor class, with visualizations
- **Polynomial_Regression_Model.ipynb**: polynomial regression model using scikit-learn's PolynomialFeatures class, with visualizations
- **Neural_Net.ipynb**: neural network model using torch.nn, with visualizations
  - had the best performance, reaching an accuracy of ~87% for the OCD condition
